# Pacman

I created the classic pacman game as a personal project. I initially wrote a Python version as a project for a course, the first project I had ever done in Python, but was disappointed with the final graphics of the game as it only printed to the terminal. As a result, I recreated the game with Javascript to practice my Javascript skills and also implement a graphical interface. 

## Technologies
* Python 3.6
* Pygame

## Usage
Simply open the html file and use it like any other website. Click on the arrow keys on your computer to change pacman's direction!
