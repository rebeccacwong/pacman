# Pacman

I created the classic pacman game as a personal project. I initially wrote a Python version as a project for a course but was disappointed with the final graphics of the game. As a result, I recreated the game with Javascript to practice my Javascript skills and also implement a graphical interface. 

## Usage

Simply open the html file and use it like any other website. Click on the arrow keys on your computer to change pacman's direction!
